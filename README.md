# Note Taking App

Application allows create, edit, and save note. Notes are saved automatically after typing.

## Notes

With more time dedicated to the task, I would address the improvements listed below.

- improvement of name pattern recognition to handle multiple signs "@" in note
- capturing pointer position in note and sync with pattern recognition to improve UX
- allowing to select user name from tooltip
- improving apiRequest, try to convert to generic method
- adding global state to prepare for scaling
- adding regression test
